        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Don't let the simplicity of this tasty fried fish recipe fool you: The fillets fry up perfectly cooked inside, with a beautiful golden crust. Haddock and cod are two excellent choices for our fried fish recipe, but tilapia, pollock, catfish, bass, trout, or perch will also yield a beautiful meal. Ready in 30 minutes, this is a perfect meal for a busy weeknight or to serve as a weekend lunch alongside a salad and a few dipping sauces, like classic tartar, Louisiana rémoulade, or chipotle mayonnaise.    </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black</li>
            <li>1 pound fish fillets (such as haddock, tilapia, or cod)</li>
            <li>2 cups of vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges or tartar sauce</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl or deep plate, combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper and mix well</li>
            <li>Dip 1 or 2 fish fillets into the flour mixture. Make sure they are completely coated on all sides and gently shake off any excess. Repeat the process with the remaining fillets</li>

            <li>Working in batches, fry the fish in the hot oil for about 6 minutes on each side, or until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through. Remove and set on a cooling rack to let drain</li>
            <li>Serve hot with lemon wedges, tartar sauce, or homemade rémoulade sauce, if desired. Enjoy</li>
